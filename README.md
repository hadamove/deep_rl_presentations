# Deep Reinforcement Learning Presentations

This repository contains lecture materials from two presentations I delivered at the [Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University](https://www.fi.muni.cz/), as part of the [IV125 Formela Lab Seminar](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2025/iv125) focused on advanced reinforcement learning topics.

## Presentations

### 1. Discovered Policy Optimisation (DPO)
> presented on 2025-03-07

- Mirror Learning Framework: PPO paradox, drift functions, theoretical foundation
- Meta-Learning Discovery: Evolution strategies, automatic algorithm discovery
- DPO Formula: From open to closed-form formula, outperforms PPO

### 2. Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
> presented on 2025-05-16

- GRPO vs PPO: Value model elimination, group-relative advantage
- DeepSeekMath: Base model, continual pre-training, SFT, GRPO
- DeepSeek-R1: Pure RL, GPT-o1 performance, mathematical reasoning
